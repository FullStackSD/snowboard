                <hr>
                <p>Grandvalira is a resort located in Andorra which covers the skiable areas of two of Andorra's seven
                    “parishes” (or provinces). It was founded back in 2003 when two of the Pyrenees' oldest resorts, Pas
                    de la Casa-Grau Roig (founded in 1956) and Soldeu-El Tarter (founded in 1964), joined together.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Montmalus (Grau Roig): Accessible from the Montmalus drag lift, this is a great red that is usually
                    quite quiet. It takes you through some stunning scenery and then back down to Grau Roig. Make sure
                    you go left as you leave the drag lift, otherwise you’ll be off down a steep narrow black!

                    Moreto (Grau Roig): A surprisingly difficult red which is accessed from the Cubil chairlift in Grau
                    Roig. Nice and wide at the top with some steep pitches, it narrows for the last third and also has a
                    tendency to bump up towards the end of the day. Definitely one to get the leg muscles burning!</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The Ordino Arcalís ski area has 30.5 km of pistes. It is north-facing, which favours the quality and
                    the quantity of the snow that the skiers find every season. In recent years, these natural
                    conditions
                    and the hosting of freeride competitions have turned it into an international benchmark for
                    off-piste
                    skiing.

                <h2>Best Runs in Ordino</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In Arcalis there are two Freeride areas. These are basically controlled off-piste areas and are great
                    for people that are wanting to explore un-pisted runs for the first time. One (accessible by the Els
                    Feixans drag lift) is specifically designed for learners, it's a small area that allows you to get
                    the feeling for being off-piste. The other (via the Creussans chairlift) is a more expansive run
                    that takes you extremely close to the France/Andorra border. They are both clearly marked on the
                    piste map further down the page.</p>
